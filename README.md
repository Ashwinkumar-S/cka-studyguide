# CKA Study Guide

I've seen quite a few resources that can help you prepare for the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) exam. I've worked through some of them and found too many errors or outdated information in others to find them useful. The purpose of this repo is primarily for my own use to work through the CKA Objectives. A secondary purpose of the repo is to provide others with another resource that can hopefully help them as a starting point on their journey to passing the CKA exam.

**NOTE** This guide is being constructed prior to me ever seeing the actual exam. Its contents are based on the official page linked above + other sample material found online. (As of this writing, the test is based on Kubernetes 1.15)
